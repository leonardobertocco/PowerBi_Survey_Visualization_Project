# PowerBi_Survey_Visualization_Project

The aim of this project was to practise creating visualisations with PowerBi from an Excel file, in this case containing answers to a public survey concerning "Jobs in the Data Science field".

After a quick data cleaning, I proceeded to visualise the most interesting data.
